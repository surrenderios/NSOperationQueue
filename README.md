# NSOperationQueue
NSOperationQueue with NSDicrectoryEnum

Cocoa operations are an object-oriented way to encapsulate work that you want to perform asynchronously. Operations are designed to be used either in conjunction with an operation queue or by themselves. Because they are Objective-C based, operations are most commonly used in Cocoa-based applications in OS X and iOS.

This chapter shows you how to define and use operations.
